# Chaos-Heart-Multiplayer
A project over which I work in my spare time and which should (probably) allow everyone to play in such a modification as the Chaos Heart  for TES:3 Morrowind

This mod is a *.esp* file with the changes necessary for the proper operation of the original Chaos Heart plugin with OpenMW multiplayer.
