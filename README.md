# Chaos-Heart-Multiplayer
A project over which I work in my spare time and which should (probably) allow everyone to play in such a modification as the Chaos Heart  for TES:3 Morrowind

This mod is a *.esp* file with the changes necessary for the proper operation of the original Chaos Heart plugin with OpenMW multiplayer.

<details>
  <summary>Things that are not fixed yet</summary>
  
  1. **_CH_Startup** script is currently not working properly, **disable** command doesn't work on OpenMW, As a result, we have many NPC's that should not be initialized in the world at the start of the game.
  2. Spells summoning multiple creatures of the same type only create one creature ([OpenMW bug](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/issues/5044))
